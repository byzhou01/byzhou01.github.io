                    <p id='p2' class='paragraphs'>"The more I learned, the more conscious did I become of the fact that I was ridiculous. So that for me my years of hard work at the university seem in the end to have existed for the sole purpose of demonstrating and proving to me, the more deeply engrossed I became in my studies, that I was an utterly absurd person." The Dream of a Ridiculous Man, Fyodor Dostoevsky </p>
                    <p id='p2' class='paragraphs'> “The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry." - Ernest Hemingway</p>
                    <p id='p2' class='paragraphs'> “Discovery is a child’s privilege. I mean the small child, the child who is not afraid to be wrong, to look silly, to not be serious, and to act differently from everyone else. He is also not afraid that the things he is interested in are in bad taste or turn out to be different from his expectations, from what they should be, or rather he is not afraid of what they actually are. He ignores the silent and flawless consensus that is part of the air we breathe – the consensus of all the people who are, or are reputed to be, reasonable.” - Alexander Grothendieck </p>
                    <p id='p2' class='paragraphs'> “All that can be said of me is that I never grow weary of learning and never get tired of teaching others!” - Confucius </p>
